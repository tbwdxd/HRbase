#Environment Setup
1.If I have installed both python2 and python3, how to use pip?
When both python2 and python3 are on the windows, both of their pip are called pip.exe. So we can’t use pip install command to install software package. 
Instead, we need to use py.exe to specify the version of pip.
windows: 
command: py -2 -m pip install XXXX-2 (python2)
	  -m means executes pip module
         py -3 -m pip install XXXX   (python3)
linux
sudo pip2 install sth
sudo pip3 install sth
